Part 2 should be completed after Part 1 and will use some small parts of that code to construct an index and load data.\n","\n","If you haven't worked with them before, Part 2 will expose you to [overloaded python operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/), which will let you call functions using alternative python syntax. For example, if you're using two Python `list` objects, you can interact with them using `+` to call the equivalent method. \n","\n","In Part 2, you'll work on the following tasks:\n"," - Construct and learn learning-to-rank pipelines\n"," - Add new features for learning-to-rank\n"," - Evaluate learning-to-rank models\n"," \n","Part 2 can be run on most laptops as well. Some of the machine learning models may take a few minutes to train but you are also welcome to run these on Great Lakes.

One option for inspecting the model is to evaluate the performance of each feature independently to see how much it contributes to the eventual relevance. To examine each feature, we will create separate a separate model from each feature in our feature pipeline (`ltr_feats1`) by using `pt.ltr.feature_to_score(i)` with a particular feature number $i$. In essence, this will only score the relevance using a single feature's values, even though we've already calculated all of them."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7nCb9U7uvszV","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":393},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636905435190,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":14788,"user":{"displayName":"Cameron Milne","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjtaJhbfEPS3clnB9ksXgylBIgoOk2Zme65bhGo2Q=s64","userId":"02706719454478835718"}},"outputId":"db019c18-d371-40ef-e9d8-b2c8597af6bc"},"source":["pt.Experiment(\n","    [ltr_feats1 >> pt.ltr.feature_to_score(i) for i in range(len(fnames))],\n","    test_topics,\n","    qrels, \n","    names=fnames,\n","    eval_metrics=[\"map\", \"ndcg\", \"ndcg_cut_10\", \"num_rel_ret\"]) #\"BM25 + LMart(7f)\""],"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["15:57:01.263 [main] WARN org.terrier.querying.ApplyTermPipeline - The index has no termpipelines configuration, and no control configuration is found.
